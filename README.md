# StableEnergy
A Simplified notebook for Smoothed Energy Guidance in Stable Diffusion 2.1 base

We put together a notebook implementation of Smooth Energy Guidance based of this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00760
A query blurring method that yield significant to the sampling process of SD 2.1 base and it's results in Vanillia and Classfier Free Guidance sampling.
